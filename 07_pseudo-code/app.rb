#Pseudo Code for the following Problems
=begin

###a method that returns the sum of two integers### 


START

GET 2 integers from user, validate that they are integers
SET those two integers in an array called numbers
SET variable sum equal to nil
SET array_index = 0

WHILE iterator <=1
  SET sum = value of array at index value of array_index
  go to the next iteration

PRINT sum

END



###a method that takes an array of strings, and returns a string that is all those strings concatenated together###

START
SET array_of_strings = to an array with several strings
SET count_aostrings = to the number of items in the array_of_strings
SET concatenated_string = to an empty string
SET current_string = to an empty string
SET iterations = to 0

WHILE iterations < count_aostrings
  SET current_string = to the value of array_of_strings at index iterations
  SET concatenated_string = to value of concatenated_string + value of current_string

PRINT concatenated_string

END
